# Thanks

for the poopy codegen

## Example

Check out [this](./example/index.js) for how to use it, and [what gets generated from it](./example/generated/page.ts). You can remove the TypeScript bits from the code inside the functions and try it out at [https://jharrilim.github.io](https://jharrilim.github.io).

To fiddle with the example, just run `npm run build` so you have the js in ./dist, change the url in the `thanks()` function, and run `node example`.
